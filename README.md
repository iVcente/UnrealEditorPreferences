# Unreal Editor Preferences
Here are personal global settings for the Unreal Editor. Instead of having to set all your `Editor Peferences` per project, you can have them enabled globally across all projects by pasting the `.ini` files of this repository into `C:/Users/{YourUser}/Documents/Unreal Engine/Engine/Config/`.
In case the changes in the `.ini` files don't seem to be working, delete the `Saved` directory from your project directory.
